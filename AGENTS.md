# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

## Test

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

This is the same command CI runs. The suite must pass before you open or update a pull request.

## Run

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Rules

- Never touch `infra/`. It is human-only.
- Synthetic data only.
- See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for coding standards and `.github/instructions/` for path-specific rules.
